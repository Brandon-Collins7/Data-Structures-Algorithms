Do I need to account for the null and length of 0 in the notes??
What about IllegalArgumentException??

can't throw IllegalArgumentException for methods when null array because can't use a method with a null object


Employ generality? can't for min, max due to needing >= and <=
***COULD add iterator method for linear scanning
***Could also change to List and Collection



String str = "abcdef";
String str2 = "";
for(int i = 0; i < str.length(); i++){
    str2 = str.charAt(i) + str2;
}
