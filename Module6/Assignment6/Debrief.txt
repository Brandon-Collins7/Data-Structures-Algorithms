getMinLadder()
use queue for BFS. track visited elements
Don't search the queue.
enqueue neighbors
(array deque)
keep a scalable data structure of already-generated neighbors (HashSet)
BFS "with memory" keep track of path taken
because BFS, as soon as find word, have a min path. Node based queue


store lexicon in trie, treeset, or hashset
